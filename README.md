# SonarAnalyzer experiments
[SonarAnalyzer](https://github.com/SonarSource/sonar-dotnet) (for .NET) 
is one of the best tools (and the best static code analysis tool) that I know of
to help you writer better code. However, it is not perfect.

So, to help my report bugs, and/or do feature requests I have this dedicated
project to experiment with.

## Reported Isues
* [False positives: implementations of violations should not trigger issues](https://github.com/SonarSource/sonar-dotnet/issues/2344)
* [Rule S3881: False positive and/or too vague message](https://github.com/SonarSource/sonar-dotnet/issues/2339)
* [Rule S2259: False positive on switch statements](https://github.com/SonarSource/sonar-dotnet/issues/2338)
