# SonarAnalyzer experiments
[SonarAnalyzer](https://github.com/SonarSource/sonar-dotnet) (for .NET) 
is one of the best tools (and the best static code analysis tool) that I know of
to help you writer better code. However, it is not perfect.

So, to help my report bugs, and/or do feature requests I have this dedicated
project to experiment with.
